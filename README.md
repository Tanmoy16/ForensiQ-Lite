# ForensiQ-Lite
ForensiQ-Lite is a lightweight forensic investigation tool that correlates disk, log, and memory artifacts to automatically reconstruct a chronological attack timeline.  Instead of raw logs or tool outputs, it produces a clear investigative narrative that explains what happened, when it happened, and how — while preserving forensic integrity.
